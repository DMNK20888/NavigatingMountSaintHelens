# NavigatingMountSaintHelens
A search algorithm project which finds the distance between two points on a topographical map of Mount Saint Helens. It uses a python backend and a PySimpleGUI GUI. It is packaged into an executable using PyInstaller. The program implements Dijkstra's search algorithm as we as the A* and weighted A* algorithms. The A* algorithms have admissible heuristics which aid in their search for the goal point.

Getting it running:
First download all of the files. There are multiple dependencies that need to be downloaded as well. The necessary python packages are PySimpleGUI, Matplotlib, and numpy. Besides these packages any stable version of python 3 needs to be installed as well. 

The command to run the program is: "python Main.py"
This should be run once you have navigated to the directory in terminal where the above files are downloaded.
